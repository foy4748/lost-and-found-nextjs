      <p>
        At FindMyLost, we believe in the power of community and technology to
        reunite people with their lost belongings. Our mission is to create a
        seamless and efficient platform where lost items can find their way back
        to their rightful owners.

      <h3 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center my-8">Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Founded in 2023, FindMyLost was born out of a simple yet powerful idea:
        to make the world a smaller place by connecting people with their lost
        items. Our founder, Jane Doe, experienced the frustration of losing a
        valuable item and realized there was a need for a better solution. With
        a background in technology and a passion for helping others, Jane set
        out to create a platform that would make lost and found processes easier
        and more effective.
